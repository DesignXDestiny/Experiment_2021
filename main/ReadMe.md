The index.html and main.css are now basic boiler plates.  the webpage is now easier on the eyes. 

__CSS__
    * No media queries- it is more stuff to look through to figure out why it broke.  Instead I wrote it in a way that should be friendly in any browser, even if it is not the most dynamic. 
    
__HTML__

I am discovering how to use the command line.  I want to be able to communicate with my computer more effectively. Learning to navigate.
Created this directory with the command line. Included in this directory are files:
    * ReadMe.md (this Document)
    * index.html
    * main.css
    * scripts.js

Application _XCode_ is updated as well as the _MacOS_ of this Mini.
